# üèéÔ∏è F1Tenth Simulator Usage ‚Äì Running Driving Algorithms (Wall Following & Pure Pursuit)

This document explains how to run **Wall Following** and **Pure Pursuit** algorithms in the F1Tenth simulator environment.

---

## 1. Setup ROS2 Environment and Build

In the simulator workspace (`/sim_ws`), run:

```bash
/sim_ws$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash   # Setup ROS2 Foxy
/sim_ws$ colcon build                      # Build workspace
/sim_ws$ source install/setup.bash         # Source built packages
```

* `setup.bash`: Load ROS2 environment variables
* `colcon build`: Build ROS2 workspace

---

## 2. Run Wall Following

### (1) Launch Simulator

In a new terminal inside the Docker container:

```bash
/sim_ws$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ source install/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```

* `gym_bridge_launch.py`: Launches the GUI simulator and connects to ROS2

---

### (2) Run Wall Following Node

In another terminal inside the container:

```bash
/sim_ws$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ source install/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ ros2 run wall_follow wall_follow_node.py
```

* `wall_follow_node.py`: Runs the wall-following driving algorithm

---

## 3. Run Pure Pursuit

The Pure Pursuit algorithm runs from its own node or package, similar to Wall Following.

### (1) Launch Simulator

```bash
/sim_ws$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ source install/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```

---

### (2) Run Pure Pursuit Node

```bash
/sim_ws$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ source install/setup.bash
/sim_ws$ ros2 run pure_pursuit pure_pursuit_node.py
```

* `pure_pursuit_node.py`: Follows a given waypoint path

---

## 4. Key Files and Directories

### (1) Map Files

* Extensions: `.png`, `.pgm`, `.yaml`
* Purpose: Map images (obstacles, paths) + metadata (resolution, origin, etc.)
* Location:

```bash
src/f1tenth_gym_ros/maps/
```

---

### (2) Waypoint Files

* Extension: `.csv`
* Purpose: Coordinate data for Pure Pursuit paths
* Location:

```bash
src/f1tenth-software-stack/csv_data/
```

* Recommended: Use same naming as map file (`map_xxx.png` ‚Üî `map_xxx.csv`)

---

## 5. Running with a New Map

1. Add map file to `src/f1tenth_gym_ros/maps/`
2. Add corresponding waypoint file to `src/f1tenth-software-stack/csv_data/`
3. Launch simulator ‚Üí Run Pure Pursuit or Wall Following node

---

## 6. Conclusion

By configuring custom maps and waypoints, you can perform diverse simulations and compare/improve the performance of **Wall Following** and **Pure Pursuit** algorithms.
